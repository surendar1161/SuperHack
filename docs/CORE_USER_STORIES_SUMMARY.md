### 3. **📅 Routine Maintenance Scheduling** (User Story 3)
**"As a client support lead: I want the agent to schedule and pre-assign routine maintenance tickets, so no preventive task is ever missed, and my technicians always have clear, actionable tasks."**

**✅ IMPLEMENTED:**
- `MaintenanceScheduler` with flexible recurring schedules
- Automatic ticket/task creation for due maintenance
- Skill-based technician assignment
- Overdue detection and escalation
- Integration with existing SuperOps ticket/task APIs

**📊 Benefits:**
- Zero missed maintenance tasks
- Proactive system health management
- Optimized technician workload distribution
- Clear, actionable maintenance procedures

### 4. **📊 Daily Work Prioritization** (User Story 4)
**"As a technician: I want the agent to summarize open tasks, flag urgent SLAs, and notify me proactively so I can prioritize my daily work effectively."**

**✅ IMPLEMENTED:**
- `DailyWorkPrioritizer` with intelligent scoring algorithm
- SLA monitoring and breach prevention
- Priority-based work queue management
- Proactive notifications for urgent items
- Daily work summaries with key metrics

**📊 Benefits:**
- Never miss SLA deadlines
- Optimized daily work prioritization
- Proactive workload management
- Clear visibility into urgent tasks
