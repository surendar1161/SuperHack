## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Request Processing
```python
from src.agents.it_technician_agent import ITTechnician

agent = ITTechnician()
response = await agent.process_request(
    "My computer keeps freezing and showing blue screen errors"
)
```

### Tool Execution
```python
# Analyze a request
result = await agent.execute_tool(
    "analyze_request", 
    request_text="Printer not working"
)

# Create a ticket
ticket = await agent.execute_tool(
    "create_ticket",
    title="Printer Issues",
    description="HP LaserJet not printing",
    priority="HIGH"
)
```

### Performance Analytics
```python
metrics = await agent.execute_tool(
    "performance_metrics",
    date_range="last_30_days",
    metric_types=["resolution_time", "sla_compliance"]
)
```
