# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive SLA (Service Level Agreement) management tools that integrate with the SuperOps API to retrieve, monitor, and manage SLA data for IT tickets and technician performance. The system will provide real-time SLA tracking, breach detection, and reporting capabilities to ensure service quality standards are maintained.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an IT manager, I want to retrieve SLA configurations from SuperOps, so that I can understand the service level commitments for different ticket types and priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system requests SLA configurations THEN it SHALL retrieve all active SLA policies from SuperOps API
2. WHEN SLA data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL parse and store SLA thresholds, response times, and resolution times
3. IF SLA configuration changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update local SLA data
4. WHEN SLA data is requested THEN the system SHALL return structured SLA information including priority levels, response times, and resolution targets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an IT technician, I want to check SLA status for specific tickets, so that I can prioritize my work and ensure compliance with service commitments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ticket ID is provided THEN the system SHALL retrieve current SLA status for that ticket
2. WHEN SLA status is calculated THEN the system SHALL determine time remaining until SLA breach
3. IF a ticket is approaching SLA breach THEN the system SHALL flag it as at-risk
4. WHEN SLA status is requested THEN the system SHALL return response time compliance, resolution time remaining, and breach risk level

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an IT manager, I want to monitor SLA performance across all technicians, so that I can identify performance issues and optimize resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technician SLA performance is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve SLA metrics for all active technicians
2. WHEN calculating technician performance THEN the system SHALL include average response time, resolution time, and SLA compliance rate
3. IF a technician has poor SLA performance THEN the system SHALL identify them for management attention
4. WHEN performance data is aggregated THEN the system SHALL provide team-wide SLA statistics and trends

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an IT manager, I want to receive alerts for SLA breaches, so that I can take immediate corrective action to maintain service quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an SLA breach occurs THEN the system SHALL generate an immediate alert notification
2. WHEN SLA breach is detected THEN the system SHALL include ticket details, breach type, and recommended actions
3. IF multiple breaches occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize alerts based on ticket priority and customer impact
4. WHEN breach alerts are sent THEN the system SHALL log the incident for reporting and analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an IT manager, I want to generate SLA reports, so that I can analyze service performance trends and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SLA reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive performance reports
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include SLA compliance rates, breach incidents, and performance trends
3. IF custom date ranges are specified THEN the system SHALL filter data accordingly
4. WHEN reports are completed THEN the system SHALL provide exportable data in multiple formats

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure SLA monitoring parameters, so that I can customize the system to match our specific service commitments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SLA parameters are configured THEN the system SHALL validate configuration against SuperOps API constraints
2. WHEN monitoring thresholds are set THEN the system SHALL apply them to all relevant tickets
3. IF configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL update monitoring rules without service interruption
4. WHEN parameters are saved THEN the system SHALL persist configuration and apply to future SLA calculations
